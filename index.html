                        <p>When I was 18, I made the mistake almost all 18 year olds make and decided to blindly choose a major upon entering college. Almost no one at that age knows what they want to do with their lives. I decided to go with Biology, because I'd done well in those classes in High School. After graduating, I realized that I <i>hated</i> Biology. It was the pits! I'm super queasy when it comes to blood, so the medical field was out, and I also didn't like the idea of going through more schooling to get into the more academic side of the field. So I tried my hand at Web Development.
                        </p>
                        <p>I was always the in-house IT guy for my family, as most young people are, but I felt like I really understood it better than the average Joe. I started teaching myself some computer science fundamentals. What I was lacking there was a structured learning environment, so I didn't make great progress. It mostly just took a long time, and it was hard to work through issues without outside help. I did learn enough to land a junior position at a web dev company, but I still really felt like I didn't grasp the fundamentals.</p>
                        <p>I also kept getting into random semi-related things, like running minecraft servers, and creating/editing game mods. The most recent one is Beat Saber, which I make custom song charts for. It's super fun! My most recent one is <a href="https://youtu.be/vCbgECLTxpU">Good Times Roll</a> by Griz &amp; Big Gigantic. But I really wanted to stop beating around the bush and actually get a handle on the full-stack.</p>
                        <p>In comes the coding bootcamp! Now I get to live the dream of a structured learning environment studying a subject I really want to learn and I know I want to get into professionally. Let's get coding!</p>
